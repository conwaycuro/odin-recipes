    <p>Wiener Schnitzel is one of Austria&rsquo;s most iconic national dishes—an 
        elegant yet straightforward preparation of tender veal, lightly breaded and 
        pan-fried to a crisp, golden perfection. Its origins trace back to 19th-century 
        Vienna, where it became a symbol of refined Central European cuisine. The 
        hallmark of an authentic Wiener Schnitzel is its light, airy breading that 
        gently puffs during frying, creating a delicate crust that never overshadows 
        the juicy veal inside. Traditionally served with fresh lemon wedges and classic 
        sides like warm potato salad, parsley potatoes, or tart lingonberry preserves, 
        this dish strikes a beautiful balance between rich, savory flavor and refreshing 
        accompaniments. Whether you're preparing it for a holiday dinner or a weekend 
        meal, Wiener Schnitzel brings a taste of old-world comfort and timeless culinary 
        tradition to the table.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 veal cutlets (about 5 oz each), pounded to 1/4 inch thickness</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup plain breadcrumbs (preferably homemade or fine)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or clarified butter, for frying (about 1/2 inch deep in 
            pan)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
  <     li>Place the veal cutlets between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently 
  pound with a meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. Season both sides with salt 
  and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and 
            one with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge each cutlet in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip into the beaten 
            eggs, then coat thoroughly with breadcrumbs. Do not press the crumbs into 
            the meat—this helps the coating puff up while frying.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil or clarified butter in a large 
            skillet over medium to medium-high heat until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Fry each cutlet one at a time (or two if your pan allows), for 2–3 
            minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy. Gently shake the pan 
            while frying to encourage even browning and “soufflé” effect.</li>
        <li>Transfer the schnitzels to a paper towel–lined plate to drain excess oil. 
            Keep warm in a low oven if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with lemon wedges and your choice of traditional sides like 
            potato salad, parsley potatoes, or lingonberry jam.</li>
    </ol>
